short_description: Invokes a PowerShell DSC configuration
description:
     - Invokes a PowerShell DSC Configuration. Requires PowerShell version 5 (February release or newer). Note that most of the parameters are dynamic and will vary
	 depending on the DSC Resource. If the DSC resource takes a parameter named "Name", use the parameter "item_name" in Ansible to represent it.
	 
	 Also note that credentials are handled as follows: If the resource accepts a credential type property called "cred", the ansible parameters would be cred_username and cred_password. 
	 These will be used to inject a credential object on the fly for the DSC resource.
	 
options:
  resource_name:
